TwitchDown is a Perl script for downloading twitch.tv VODs (Video-On-Demand),
similar to TwitchVODDownloader tool:
http://www.twitchvods.com/download/
Main difference is that TwitchVODDownloader starts ffmpeg for direct converting
video from remote URL, while TwitchDown first downloads all segments locally and
then starts ffmpeg to combine them. This requires disk space twice as video
would take, but ensures that all segments are downloaded correctly: with remote
URL some segments may be silently skipped due to connectivity issues during
download.

Other differences from TwitchVODDownloader:
* No GUI.
* No authorization.
* Instead of end time, the total length can be specified.
* Warnings about muted segments and video discontinuities.

	perl twitchdown.pl {URL|VideoID} {FileName} [Options]
